# MineClone2 Porting Mods Request

**Mods sorting is made here: https://github.com/orgs/mineclone2-mods/projects/2**

If you got the idea of a cool minecraft mod that should be ported to MineClone2, just suggest it in issues.

After approval from owners, somebody with write access can create the repository and start working on it.

If you aren't a part of the organisation you can eventually be given access to a specific repository or to the organisation itself by the owners.
